Designed and implemented a non-isolated Zeta converter using TL494-based PWM control to achieve a variable
 output (6–18 V) from a 12 V input with 10 kHz switching.– Verified converter performance in both Continuous and Discontinuous Conduction Modes through waveform anal
ysis of inductor voltage and diode current.
